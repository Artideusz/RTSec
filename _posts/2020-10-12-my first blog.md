I just wanted to say that I had alot of fun learning about jekyll and I recommend you learn it too! Github pages is completely for free and it's probably the best solution if you want to develop a static page website.

## What I'm planning for this website.

I am thinking about making a schedule for creating posts. I would create new posts on this website every 2 weeks talking about cybersecurity topics, vulnerabilities, interesting CVEs that I have found and sometimes new technologies and tools that can help us as pentesters and hackers. I'm also planning to make a sidebar with a list of categories to filter out irrelevant to an individual posts (something in the lines of: Blue team, Red team, CVEs, Trending and other). 

The next thing on my list is to expand the learning corner and change the content of some of the notes so that it could be understood by all people with different levels of knowledge about a given topic. I will also attach additional resource links where you can study further about it. After that I am going to work on a search bar for both the posts and notes, so an individual can find a specific item faster.

## What's after that?

I am not completely sure, besides creating posts and expanding the learning corner, I'll probably work on some kind of pentesting tool or do bug bounties and CTFs in my spare time. We will see.
