        <p>Hi! My name is Arthur, I am <span id="age"></span> years old and I am interested in I.T. and cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>I got interested in programming when I was 18 and created a couple of projects, from a simple HTML5 canvas tank game, to a small SEO automation framework using a programming language called Node.js.</p>
        <p>At the age of 20, I discovered the beautiful world of cybersecurity and hacking. After studying various cyberattacks like XSS and SQLis, I figured "why not study topics and teach them to people at the same time?", so I made this platform just for this purpose.</p>
        <p>My dream is to become a pentester one day, and I will strive to achieve that goal.</p>
        <p>My motto is:</p>
        <p class="motto">Successful people never give up, your goal is to become one of them!</p>
